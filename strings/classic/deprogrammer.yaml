action:
  break:
    - |
      You go to [target]'s house.
      While repeating to yourself that it's for the greater good, you use all your knowledge of conditioning to thoroughly break [target].
      Leaving [target] behind sleeping peacefully, you feel the immorality of your action like a weight on your shoulders.
      You now know that - despite everything the hypnotists are doing - you won't be able to erase another person's mind ever again.
  save:
    - |
      You go to [target]'s house, where they appear to be sleeping peacefully - but you know what really is up.
      You set up your gear and spent an hour un-conditioning them.
      Unfortunately, your gear breaks just as [target] shuffles to wake up.
      You gather the broken pieces and leave hurriedly, but you won't be able to un-condition anybody else for a while.
  skip:
    - |
      Convinced that doing nothing for now is the right choice, you go back to sleep.
  timeout:
    - |
      You stay up all night wondering what to do. The dawn breaks and your opportunities are now gone.

reveal:

    The villagers check [target]'s house out.
    They find manuals about self-worth, analysis of hypnosis and some pretty complicated techniques about breaking conditioning.
    It appears [targetMention] was a deprogrammer.
