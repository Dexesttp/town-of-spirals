## Ideas

### Some dialogues
X has been voted guilty by the town, and is now Broken. Not that they're complaining anymore.
You got brainwashed! Your mind now belongs to another!
Someone got brainwashed! Another pet is now up for adoption~!
Someone got brainwashed! hohoho~ a new slave has joined the workforce!
The day begins anew, but can the same be said for the people~
Someone got brainwashed! They are  now  a happy little doll~
Oh the night has fallen~ and the brainwashing begins~

### Some role ideas
So, for the arsonist, you could have it be somebody who can bombard a person with subliminals each night while they sleep, and then to break them, they can choose to use a trigger phrase at night instead which breaks all subliminal'd townies.

And for the doctor, you could have it be somebody with a deprogramming helmet, who can visit a person each night and try to clear any brainwashing they may have from their minds.
Which could prevent people from being broken that night, and maybe even cure suspected thralls.

Hypnofetishist => wins by being brainwashed by the town
Cultist => converts one new member every night, win when all are cultists
Eldritch => can resist one attempt at brainwashing (day or night)
Purifier => can "un-break" somebody every two days, so that they can vote during the day and act during the night. They still count as broken, and if re-broken cannot be purified again.
Subliminalist => sway one person's votes for the next day.
