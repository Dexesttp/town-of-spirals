X has been voted guilty by the town, and is now Broken. Not that they're complaining anymore.
You got brainwashed! Your mind now belongs to another!
Someone got brainwashed! Another pet is now up for adoption~!
Someone got brainwashed! hohoho~ a new slave has joined the workforce!
The day begins anew, but can the same be said for the people~
Someone got brainwashed! They are  now  a happy little doll~
Oh the night has fallen~ and the brainwashing begins~


So, for the arsonist, you could have it be somebody who can bombard a person with subliminals each night while they sleep, and then to break them, they can choose to use a trigger phrase at night instead which breaks all subliminal'd townies.

And for the doctor, you could have it be somebody with a deprogramming helmet, who can visit a person each night and try to clear any brainwashing they may have from their minds.
Which could prevent people from being broken that night, and maybe even cure suspected thralls.
